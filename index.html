        <h1>Hello! I'm Ingrid</h1>
        <p>
            Thanks to Techtonica, I'm in the process of becoming a Software Engineer, <br>
            My journey to coding started when I became eager to know how HTML, CSS and JavaScript worked together.

        <h3>Code Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I'm passionate and curious about learning UX/UI and web design. <br>
            My past job experiences have taught me many lessons, which can be applied anywhere:

            Events Supervisor at the Yerba Buena Gardens Festival enjoying the park. Before that I was in the non-profit world teaching
            kids how to make impactful art. 
             I use color, graphics and animation to enhance the world one pixel at a time. 
             I strive to engage the audience in wanting to know more by telling them a story where they can also participate. 
            I love to collaborate with teams or work alone and know how to get things moving!-->
